TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock dut/u_e203_subsys_top/u_e203_subsys_main/u_e203_subsys_perips/u_hdmi_display_wrapper/video_pll_m0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_mmcm and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition

Runtime intensive exceptions  
The following constraint contains more than 10000 objects. To preserve runtime and memory performance, it is recommended to include minimum number of objects. Check whether this list can be simplified.

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hier -include_replicated_objects -filter {NAME =~ *temp_mon_enabled.u_tempmon/device_temp_sync_r1_reg[*]/D}]' of constraint 'set_max_delay' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '6' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
